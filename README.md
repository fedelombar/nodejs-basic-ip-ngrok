# Node.js Server with NGROK for Retrieving IP Address

This repository contains a simple example of creating a Node.js server that utilizes NGROK to retrieve the external IP address of the server. This can be useful for various purposes, such as debugging, testing network configurations, or accessing your server from external devices.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js: Make sure you have Node.js installed on your system. You can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-nodejs-ngrok-ip-server.git
cd your-nodejs-ngrok-ip-server
```

2. Install the required dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the Node.js server:

```bash
node app.js
```

4. Install NGROK globally (if not already installed):
```bash
npm install -g ngrok
```

5. Expose the local server using NGROK:
```bash
ngrok http 3000
```

6. Accessing the IP Address:
Once NGROK has started, it will provide a publicly accessible URL that tunnels to your local server. You can use this URL to retrieve the external IP address of your server.

## Usage

Access the NGROK URL provided in the terminal after running the ngrok command.
The server will respond with the IP address information.
Customization
You can customize the behavior of the server by modifying the server.js file according to your requirements.
